# How do machines acquire bias and what can we do against it?

This question has been bugging me recently. I am intrigued to find out more about **machine bias** and **methods on how to counteract** this bias.

This repository should work as a wiki, article collection and a future playgorund for projects that further investigate this topic.

**Input, contributions and pointing out errors** are more than welcome, please contact me on mail@tim-berger.eu!
